# Home Assessment – Infra / Platform Engineer

## Objective

Build a small **Temporal-based distributed system**, package it as a reusable worker SDK, and run it locally on Kubernetes.

You are free to choose language (Go or Python recommended) and design decisions.
Focus on correctness, platform thinking, and engineering quality.

---

## Requirements

### 1️⃣ Worker SDK

Create a small framework/SDK for running Temporal workers.

It should include:

* Standardized worker bootstrap (configurable via env)

Design it as if other teams will use it.

---

### 2️⃣ Distributed Calculator Workflow

Implement a workflow that evaluates an arithmetic expression like:


1 + 5^3 * (2 - 5)


Requirements:

* Input is a single string expression
* Support operators: `+ - * / ^` and parentheses
* Respect precedence and associativity
* Each operator type must be executed by a **different worker and task queue**
* The workflow orchestrates the execution

Design and parsing approach is up to you.

---

### 3️⃣ SDK Upgrade Requirement


Add:
* Graceful shutdown
* Basic observability (metrics + logs)
* liveness and readiness probes

Add health probes in a way that:

* Existing workers do not require code changes
* Only upgrading the SDK enables probes

---

### 4️⃣ Kubernetes

Run everything on a local Kubernetes cluster (kind/minikube/etc).

Provide:

* Manifests or Helm
* Script to deploy
* Script to trigger a complex calculation

---

### 5️⃣ Bonus – Autoscaling

Implement horizontal autoscaling for workers.

Provide:

* A stress test that increases and decreases load
* Explanation of:

  * Which metric you scale on
  * Why you chose it
  * Limitations of your approach

---

## Deliverables

* Source code
* README explaining how to run
* Short design explanation (architecture + tradeoffs)
* If LLM was used:

  * Prompts
  * Planning approach
  * Number of iterations
  * How iterations could be reduced

---

## What We Evaluate

* Engineering quality
* System design thinking
* Clarity of explanation
